To start sending a campaign to a prospect you have to create a **subscription**. The subscription is then used to described the current status of the campaign for the prospect.

You can take manual actions on a subscription to `pause`, `resume` or `stop` a campaign for a specific prospect.

A subscription can also be automatically `completed` after the last [campaign step](#campaign-steps) is sent.
A subscription can also be automatically `stopped` if we register one of the [`campaigns.stop_when` events](#the-campaign-object).

## Create a subscription
<aside class="deprecation">
Warning — Campaigns will be deprecated soon. You should use the <a href="#automations">Automations</a> instead.
</aside>
```shell
# DEFINITION
POST https://api.prospect.io/public/v1/campaigns/{{CAMPAIGN_ID}}/subscriptions

# EXAMPLE
curl -X POST "https://api.prospect.io/public/v1/campaigns/1/subscriptions" \
-H "Authorization: your_api_key" \
-H "Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json; charset=utf-8" \
-d '{
  "data": {
    "type": "subscriptions",
    "attributes": {
      "prospect_id": 1,
      "user_id": 1,
      "start_date": "24/11/2016",
      "start_time": "09:30:00"
    }
  }
}'
```

This will create a new subscription. The start of the subscription, *i.e.* when the first campaign step is performed, can be scheduled by passing a `start_date` and a `start_time` in the parameters. Both `start_date` and `start_time` are defined in the timezone of the user who makes the API call. If the `start_date` or the `start_time` is missing, the subscription will be started immediately.

### Parameters
Parameter | Required? | Type | Description
--------- | --------- | ---- | ------------
prospect_id | **yes** | *integer* | The prospect's ID
user_id | **yes** | *integer* | The sender's ID
start_date | no | *string* | The date at wich the first email of the campaign must be sent, in the format `dd/mm/yyyy`.
start_time | no | *string* | The time of the day at which the first email of the campaign must be sent, in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

### Returns
Returns the [subscription object](#the-subscription-object).


## Stop a subscription

# DEFINITION

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "1",
